## Topic Outline


### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
- Brief history of computer vision and its evolution with AI.
- Why it matters: Real-world impacts and potential applications across various domains.

### 2. Basics of Computer Vision (25 minutes)
- Defining computer vision: The process by which machines "see" and interpret images.
- Key components: Sensors (cameras), processing units, algorithms.
- Difference between traditional image processing and AI-based computer vision.

### 3. Dive into AI: Neural Networks and Deep Learning (30 minutes)
- Brief overview of what neural networks are, focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- Explain how deep learning has revolutionized computer vision tasks.
- Show simple visual examples to demonstrate how layers in a CNN can detect patterns and features (like edges, textures, and objects).

### 4. Current Capabilities of Computer Vision (25 minutes)
- Image classification: Assigning labels to images.
- Object detection: Identifying and locating objects in images.
- Semantic segmentation: Assigning a label to every pixel in an image, i.e., determining which pixels belong to which object.
- Facial recognition, pose estimation, and more.
- Showcase real-life examples and applications for each capability.

### 5. Challenges & Ethical Considerations (20 minutes)
- Limitations of current AI models: biases, overfitting, adversarial attacks, and data requirements.
- Ethical concerns: Privacy, misuse (surveillance, deepfakes), and decision-making accountability.
- Emphasize the importance of understanding these challenges, especially for researchers wanting to incorporate these technologies into their work.

### 6. The Future and Horizon (15 minutes)
- Emerging technologies and methods: Transformers in vision, unsupervised learning, and hybrid models.
- Potential applications: Augmented reality, advanced healthcare imaging, and environmental monitoring.
- Encouraging researchers to imagine the applications in their own fields.

### 7. Q&A and Discussion (15 minutes)
- Allow participants to ask questions and discuss potential applications to their respective research areas.
- Provide resources for further learning.
