In "The Terminator," a relentless cyborg assassin known as the Terminator is sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, the mother of future resistance leader John Connor. Simultaneously, Kyle Reese, a soldier from the future, is also sent back to protect Sarah. The film delves into themes of fate, technology run amok, and the potential consequences of time travel. The Terminator's iconic red-hued vision provides a computer's perspective, illustrating its objectives and showcasing early concepts of computer vision in film.

### [Terminator 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103064/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)

**Based on:** Characters created by James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd.

**Director:** James Cameron

**Starring:** Arnold Schwarzenegger | Linda Hamilton | Edward Furlong | Robert Patrick

**Released:** 1991

**Set in:** Primarily 1995, with glimpses into a post-apocalyptic 2029.

In "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Skynet, the malevolent AI from the future, sends a new and more advanced Terminator, the T-1000, back to 1995 to eliminate John Connor as a young boy. Meanwhile, the resistance reprograms a captured Terminator, the T-800 model (Schwarzenegger), and sends it back in time to protect John. With the aid of his mother Sarah, and the T-800, John battles the T-1000. The film touches on themes of destiny, the nature of humanity, and the potential catastrophic impact of unchecked technological advancements. The T-1000, with its liquid metal form, introduced groundbreaking visual effects to cinema and further illustrated advanced concepts of robotics and computer vision.

### [Robocop](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093870/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)

**Based on:** Original screenplay by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner.

**Director:** Paul Verhoeven

**Starring:** Peter Weller | Nancy Allen | Dan O'Herlihy | Ronny Cox | Kurtwood Smith

**Released:** 1987

**Set in:** A dystopian Detroit in the near future (though a specific year isn't mentioned).

In "RoboCop," Officer Alex Murphy is brutally attacked and left for dead by a gang of criminals. The mega-corporation Omni Consumer Products (OCP) takes advantage of Murphy's condition to transform him into RoboCop, a cyborg law enforcement officer designed to serve as the ultimate solution to crime in a city on the brink of collapse. As RoboCop starts to regain fragments of his human memories, he seeks vengeance against those who wronged him, all while uncovering corruption within OCP. The film examines themes of identity, the human soul, corporate greed, and the ethical dilemmas surrounding advanced technology. RoboCop's interface, enhanced vision, and targeting systems represent early depictions of computer vision and augmented reality in cinema.

This example is illustrative of some of the perils of computer vision...
