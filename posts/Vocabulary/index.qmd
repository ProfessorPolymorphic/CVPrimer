# COMPUTER VISION: Common Vocabulary

## Foundations & Key Concepts:
- **Computer Vision:** The field of study that enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data (images, videos).
- **Image Processing:** Techniques to manipulate images to enhance or extract information.
- **Deep Learning:** A subset of machine learning using neural networks with many layers (deep architectures) to analyze various factors of data.

## Neural Network Architectures & Components:
- **Neural Network:** A computational model inspired by the structure of biological neural networks. Used for pattern recognition and learning.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** A type of deep learning algorithm specifically designed for processing structured grid data, such as images.
- **Activation Function:** A mathematical function applied to a neuron's output, determining the neuron's output signal.
- **Feature Map:** The output of one filter applied over the entire input image in a convolutional layer.
- **Pooling:** A technique in CNNs to down-sample the spatial dimensions of data, retaining important information.
- **Transformer Architectures:** A type of deep learning model primarily used for sequence-to-sequence tasks but is seeing increasing adoption in computer vision.

## Key Tasks in Computer Vision:
- **Image Classification:** Determining the category of an object within an image.
- **Object Detection:** Identifying and locating multiple objects within an image.
- **Semantic Segmentation:** Classifying each pixel in an image to a specific category, determining which object it belongs to.
- **Pose Estimation:** Determining the orientation or pose of a specific object or figure in an image or video.

## Techniques & Strategies:
- **Transfer Learning:** A technique where a pre-trained model (trained on a large dataset) is used as a starting point for a different, but related task.
- **Data Augmentation:** Techniques to artificially increase the size of training datasets by applying various transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling).
- **Edge Detection:** Identifying points in an image where there's a sudden change in brightness or color, useful for finding boundaries within objects.
- **Kernel:**

## Challenges & Concerns:
- **Overfitting:** When an AI model is too closely tailored to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data.
- **Adversarial Attack:** A technique to fool AI models by slightly altering the input data, leading to incorrect outputs.
- **Bias (in AI):** When an AI model produces results that are systematically prejudiced due to unfair algorithms or skewed input data.

## Emerging Technologies & Applications:
- **Augmented Reality (AR):** A technology that superimposes computer-generated content on a user's view of the real world.
