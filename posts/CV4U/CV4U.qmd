## Computer Vision 4U

What do I need to connect this technology to my research?

1. Understand the nature of your data.
2. Understand the nature of your task. (Segmentation, Classification, Detection, real time?)
3. How much training is required?  How unique is your application?
4. Where will you get the training data?
