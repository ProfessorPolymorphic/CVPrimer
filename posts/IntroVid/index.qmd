How to introduce the basics of computer vision in an efficient and engaging way?  These days, any lecture we could put together would be re-inventing the wheel.  Instead, we are going to watch a video!


While there are many videos out there on this topic, we found this one to be clear, up to date, and engaging, with many exciting example applications.  Also, they provide links to their sources in their video description and we've reproduced these links below.

That being said, it is important to understand its source.  The company that made the video is called [Altexsoft](https://www.altexsoft.com).  They are a company that applies these technologies to the hospitality industry.  Consider this information as you see fit.


## Things to ponder

As you watch the video, conder the following for additional discussion:

1. What examples (if any) are closest to applications related to your own research?
2. What concepts are still confusing or were not addressed in enough detail?
3. Was anything misleading or overhyped?
