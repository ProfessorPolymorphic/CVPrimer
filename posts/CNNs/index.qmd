## Convolutional Neural Networks

How do CNNs actually work?  What are they good at?  What are their limitations?

Terry will tell you all the answers!

### Segmentation
- Classifying pixels (car, road, pedestrian).
- Used in self-driving vehicles.

### Classification
- Determine what's in an image.
- Differentiates between dogs, cats, etc.

### Detection
- Localizes objects in images.
- Places bounding boxes around detected objects.
