## WELCOME!

Welcome to the interactive resources for the University of Idaho's 2023 [Symposium on AI Based Computer Vision](https://www.iids.uidaho.edu/registration.php?eid=644afde5a6608).  Below you will find a series of posts related to our session on Computer Vision for Beginners.  The posts include the lecture slides as well as various support materials and resources.

You can use the `sorting` and `filtering` functions to find what you are looking for, as well as the handy list of `categories` along the right hand side.
